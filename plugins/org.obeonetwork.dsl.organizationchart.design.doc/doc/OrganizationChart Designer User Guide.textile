h1. Providing Feedback

This UML modeling environment is based on the "Obeo Designer":http://www.obeodesigner.com product. It is under an
Open Source license (*EPL*) and the source code is hosted on "github":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Modeling. 

It is intended to cover most use cases behind the usage of UML, and more importantly to be reused when you apply a 
model driven approach wich uses both *UML and some DSL*. Everything should integrate seamlessly  in the same environment. 

We're constantly looking for feedback about this modeler, if you think something is missing, some behavior is weird or even just to tell us you are happy with it in its current state, *please come and exchange* on the "Obeo Network":http://www.obeonetwork.com/group/uml-designer
Fill in our "survey":http://bit.ly/UMLDesignerSurvey!

Feel free to fork the code, adapt it for your need and trigger a "pull request":https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.


h1. Getting Started

This section describes how to start using the UML designer either from existing UML models or by creating a new one.

h2. Starting from the Travel Agency example

Import the TravelAgency project using the menu @File/New/Example...@.

!gettingStarted/example-1-menu.png!

Pick the *Travel Agency UML* wizard and click on @Next@ and then @Finish@.

!gettingStarted/example-2-wizard.png!

Click Finish on the wizard and a *TravelAgency* project appears in your workspace. 

!gettingStarted/example-3-workspace.png!

When the project gets opened,  you will be greeted with the main package hierarchy diagram.

!gettingStarted/example-4-maindiag.png!

From here you can navigate to existing diagrams by right clicking on the *Model*.


h2. Create a new UML model & UML project

To create a new UML project , enable the Modeling Perspective.

!gettingStarted/perspective.png!

Then click on the wizard shortcuts at the top-right of the Eclipse Workbench. Select  __New UML Project.__ 

!gettingStarted/newUMLModel.png!

You can choose specific name for the project and the root element for the project on the next pages.

!gettingStarted/newUMLProject.png!

When you press the __Finish__ button, the projects gets created and automatically enabled the UML viewpoints.

!gettingStarted/new-workspace.png!

Now you can right click on the displayed package to create all the available diagrams or use the palette to create the package structure that fits to your needs. You can also open the Package hierarchy diagram and starts from here:

!gettingStarted/new-maindiag.png!


h2. Display & edit an existing UML model

To create a new UML design on existing UML models, simply drag & drop the models in the Project or use the __Add Model__ action available on the __Project Dependencies__ item.

!gettingStarted/new-add-dependency.png!

h2(#vpselection). UML designer viewpoints

Two viewpoints are specified on the UML designer each bringing the following views:
* UML Structural modeling
** Package hierarchy diagram
** Class diagram
** Component diagram
** Object diagram
** Composite diagram
** Deployment diagram
* UML Behavioral modeling
** State machine diagram
** Activity diagram
** Use case diagram
** Sequence diagram
* UML Profile Design
** Profile diagram

You can select either viewpoints or both depending on your use case. Note that the __Package hierarchy diagram__ is the entry point to create new diagrams such as Activity or Sequence diagrams. So it is advised to select at least the __UML Structural modeling__ viewpoint.

h1. Using the Package Hierarchy Diagram

The @Package Hierarchy@ diagram is the starting point of your modeling task. It shows you 
the structure of your model (packages and sub-packages) and enable the creation of the other diagrams.
 

h2. Creating a Class Diagram

To create a class diagram you should *right-click* on your model or on a package and pick @navigate@ and then @new Class Diagram@.

!using_package_hierarchy/create_classdiag.png!

h2. Creating a Deployment Diagram

To create a deployment diagram you should *right-click* on your model or on a package and pick @navigate@ and then @new Deployment Diagram@.

h1. Using the Class Diagram

h2. Importing primitive types

The contextual menu @Import primitive types@ can import predefined types libraries from a *right-click* on the background of a class diagram. This menu allows to import primitives for :
* UML 
* Java
* XML
* Ecore

Then, the imported types can be used in the property's definition.

Another way to import primitive types is just by editing a property on a class (by typing directly on the selected property or by hitting F2) and type the wanted datatype. If it's a known type, as String for example, the corresponding library is automatically imported : this library is visible in the model explorer when the project dependencies entry is expanded.
The case is not taken into account, so it is possible to type "string" and the "String" datatype of UML Primitive types library will be used.

h2. Creating Elements

All the elements you can create in a class diagram are available through the *palette*.

!using_class_diagram/palette.png!

You also have the ability to create elements in a contextual way related to the currently selected elements.
If your pointer is on the diagram background, after a few seconds you should see the following assistant :

!using_class_diagram/assistant.png!

If your pointer is *on a class* the assistant will be : 

!using_class_diagram/assistant_class.png!

h2. Editing Elements

h3. Generality

The generic way to edit element values is using the *properties view*. If it is not opened yet
you can open it clicking on the *Window* menu, then *Show View*  and then *Properties*

!using_class_diagram/properties.png! 

To edit a property you should then enable the *Semantic* tab :

!using_class_diagram/properties_values.png!

h3. Generic Class

To define a Generic Class, use the direct edit tool:

!using_class_diagram/generic_class.png!

To define a Binding, use the create edge tool called "Binding" from a Class to a Generic Class.
You may notice that "?" refers to an undefined actual type:

!using_class_diagram/binding1_class.png!

To specify the binding association from the formal to the actual type use also the direct edit tool:

!using_class_diagram/binding2_class.png!




h2. Using UML in colors

"UML in colors":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_colors is an object modeling technique proposed by "Peter Coad":http://www.step-10.com/SoftwareDesign/ModellingInColour/index.html, Eric Lefebvre, and Jeff De Luca in a series of articles in 1999.
!uml_in_colors/example.png!
An @Archetypes@ layer is available in the UML Designer @class diagram@.
!uml_in_colors/layer.png!

When the layer is selected, new tools are available in the palette :
!uml_in_colors/palette.png!

The modeling in color patterns and strategies are built around the idea of class archetypes.
!http://www.step-10.com/SoftwareDesign/ModellingInColour/images/FourArchetypesWithContentSideBySide.gif!
It exists four different kind of archetypes :
* *moment-interval* and *mi-detail* (pink): represents a moment or interval of time, all things that happen in the software.
* *role* (yellow): represents something/someone who participates to moment-intervals.  
* *description* (blue): represents a collection of values a kind of catalog.
* *party, place, or thing* (green): represents someone or something that plays a role.

The Domain Neutral Component (DNC) is the common pattern applied with the UML in colors technique.
!http://www.step-10.com/SoftwareDesign/ModellingInColour/images/DNC.gif!

To create an archetype in a class diagram just select an archetype from the palette of the tooltip.
The archetypes are stored in UML model as stereotyped classes.
To change an existing class to an archetype just selects the tool from the palette and the existing class. The stereotype of the selected archetype is applied on the class which is colored.

UML in colors examples are available from Eclipse menu File > New > Example... > UML > Uml in colors.

For more detailed explanation on UML in colors have a look to "Peter Coad's website":http://www.step-10.com/SoftwareDesign/ModellingInColour/index.html.

h2. Editing Attributes

We added a few accelerators so that you can quickly edit *Attributes* in a class just by typing the label. Typing : 
* @aNewName@ will update the attribute name.
* @aNewName : SomeType@ will update the attribute name and will look for the *datatype* with the given name. If found it will 
* @/someName@ will set the Attribute as *derived*.
* @=someValue@ will set the *default value* of the Attribute. 
* @[0..1]@ will set the *multiplicity* of the attribute to 0 for the lower bound and 1 for the upper bound.
* @[0..*]@ will set the *multiplicity* of the attribute to 0 for the lower bound and unbounded for the upper bound.

h1. Using the Deployment Diagram

h2. Creating Elements

All the elements you can create in a deployment diagram are available through the *palette*.

!using_deployment_diagram/palette.png!

You also have the ability to create elements in a contextual way related to the currently selected elements.
If your pointer is on the diagram background, after a few seconds you should see the following assistant :

!using_deployment_diagram/assistant.png!

If your pointer is *on a node* the assistant will be : 

!using_deployment_diagram/assistant_node.png!

In deed, a node is a composite element.

h2. Editing labels

We added a few accelerators so that you can quickly edit *labels* on elements or edges just by typing. Typing : 
* @aNewName@ will update the label.

h1. Using the Profile Diagram

!using_profile_diagram/profile_diagram.png!

h2. Creating a profile

To create a new profile, *right_click* on a model element in the Model Explorer and select the menu _New Representation > Profile Diagram_.
!using_profile_diagram/new_profile_diagram_menu.png!

Another solution is to *create a new UML model* and select *_Profile_* as root element.
!using_profile_diagram/new_profile_diagram_model.png!

h2. Creating a stereotype

A tool is available in the palette to create a stereotype. 
!using_profile_diagram/palette_stereotype.png!
!using_profile_diagram/stereotype.png!

By default, a stereotype does not extend any metaclass.

h2. Referencing a metaclass

A tool is available in the palette to import a list of metaclass.
!using_profile_diagram/palette_metaclass.png!
!using_profile_diagram/metaclass.png!

It opens a wizard which proposes all the available UML metaclass:
!using_profile_diagram/wizard_metaclass.png!

It is possible to filter the listed metaclass by :
* Name
* Only concrete metaclasses
* Only sub classes of a selected metaclass

h2. Extending a metaclass

A tool is available in the palette to create extensions for a stereotype.
!using_profile_diagram/palette_extension.png!
!using_profile_diagram/extension.png!
According to the context, this tool will create an _Extension_ edge linking _Stereotype_ to an _Element Import_ or a _Generalization_ edge linking two _Stereotypes_. An _Element Import_ is an UML reference to an imported metaclass in a profile.
!using_profile_diagram/wizard_metaclass.png!

h2. Extra associations

This tool allows the creation of an UML “Association” between two stereotypes. 
!using_profile_diagram/extra_association.png!
Furthermore, this tool can suggest to reuse the existing relationship in the metamodel UML, if this relationship can link the metaclass referenced by the target and the source stereotype of the wanted association.
If the user selects an existing relationship of the UML metamodel, then the tool will import the metaclass of the selected relationship and create a new stereotype that extend this relationship. Besides, the tool link graphically the new created stereotype and the source and target stereotype of the association
!using_profile_diagram/wizard_extra_association.png!

h2. Defining a profile

The palette provides a tool to *define a profile* in order to be able to apply this one for other UML model in the workspace. This tool add information about the version to the profile as _Ecore Annotation_. Mainly, the information required for the versioning are:
* Version number
* Date
* Author
* Comment
* Copyright
!using_profile_diagram/define_profile.png!

Another tool is available to *undefine a profile*, this tool removes all the _EPackage_ representing the definition from the profile.

h2. Exporting a profile

An _export profile_ tool is available from the palette to export a profile as a jar file. This jar can be added to an eclipse platform to provide a profile as a registered package. The export operation creates an EMF project with an ecore file based on the profile model. Then an extension for the profile is added to the generated project (in “uml.generated_package” and “ecore.uri_mapping”). Finally, the tool builds and exports the created EMF project for the profile as a Deployable plug-in.
The tool requires some necessary information for the creation of the deployable plug-in:
* Profile name, which is editable in the profile model.
* Profile URI.
* Profile plug-in name.
* Version information
!using_profile_diagram/export_profile.png!

h1. Features

h2. Class Diagram

h3. Introduction

!features/agency_pics/entities.jpg!

h3. Support for Broken Associations

It might happen that for some reason you have an *Association* instance in your package which doesn't have the proper *ends*. In that case
the class diagram will show the broken associations as nodes :

!features/class_pics/broken associations Class Diagram.jpg!

You can use the *Association* tools in the palette __(Association, Reference, Composition and Aggregation)__ to re-attach the Association to a classifier.


h3. Classes in SubComponents

A *Class Diagram* created on a Package or a Model will display the contained classes but also the classes which are contained in Components of the selected Package.

Thanks to this one can easily define a *Class Diagram* displaying all the entities abstracting the fact that they might be split across components.

h2. Component Diagram

h3. Introduction

!features/agency_pics/system architecture.jpg!

h3. Connector

You can link two ports using assembly or delegation connectors.

Assembly Connector :

h3. Required and Provided Interfaces

Using ports :

!features/component_pics/exchange through ports.jpg!

Or directy on the components :

!features/component_pics/exchange through component.jpg!

h2. Use Case Diagram

h3. Introduction

!features/agency_pics/system use cases.jpg!

h3. Use cases with or without subjects

The *Use Case Diagram* will display any @UseCase@ not being affected to a subject on the canvas. If a subject is affected, then the use case
will be displayed directly within this subject.

Dragging a use case from a subject to the canvas (and the other way around) will set or unset the subject accordingly.
