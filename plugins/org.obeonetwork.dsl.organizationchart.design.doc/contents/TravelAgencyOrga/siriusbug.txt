Tools
	Operations
		For
			i variable is not available 
				(The actual syntax will vary depending on the query language; for the legacy query language it would be $i, for Acceleo 3 simply i. )
		Create Edge View, Edge Style
			preSource is not available
				SR_Structure_Link
		Create view
			... should be proposed
		Action
			a v ariable on the semantic element should available		
		For
			Need to convert a set to a sequence (without, classcastexception)
			SR tool populate
		Operation
			only views variable available, with nothing possible
		Precondition
			during validate, should verify the query answer a boolean
		Variable
			ability to type variables
		Pane Base Selection
			no contexte and need to cast : Choose Functions
		Reconnection
			otherEnd variable is not proposed in the children node of the tool
			otherEnd should be rename otherEndView and a otherEnd variable should be provided to get access to semantic element without the need to do aql:otherEnd.oclAsType(diagram::DEdge).target
			otherEnd is about DEdge for target reconnection and DNode for source reconnection. It is not consistent
Tree
	Drop doesn't work
	tree edge doesn't respect the doc : "Tree: this style can be seen as a special case of Manhattan, with always two vertical segments and an horizontal one between them. If one graphical element serves as the source for several edges using this style, their first vertical segment (the stem of the tree) will be merged, and their horizontal segments will all appear as a single line."
	
edge
	SR manager + SC struct function
		it's hard to do a conditional style based on target or source

table
	label edit doesn't work	
		
OrderTreeLayout : children expression validation/completion is based on root element of diagram instead of NodeMapping 	
	
Q
	Del et unset dans SC Del FctEmp
	StructuresRelationShip : label on end (variable for target ?)
