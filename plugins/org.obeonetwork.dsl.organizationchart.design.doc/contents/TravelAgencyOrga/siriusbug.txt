Tools
	Operations
		Precondition
			VSM validation: should verify the query answer a boolean with a warning.
		Reconnection
			otherEnd variable is not proposed in the tree list of variables (but is available in completion)
			otherEnd should be rename otherEndView and a otherEnd variable should be provided to get access to semantic element without the need to do aql:otherEnd.oclAsType(diagram::DEdge).target
			otherEnd is about DEdge for target reconnection and DNode for source reconnection. It is not consistent.
		Operation Action
			a new variable (selectedElements?) should be proposed to obtain semantic elements concerned by this action, without the need to go inside VP MM (such as aql:self.oclAsType(diagram::DNodeListElement).target.oclAsType(organizationchart::Employee))
			-> SO_Op_Set Manager
		Change Context
			Need to use change context to just perform a Java service operation in a tool.
Tree
	Drop doesn't allow any d'n d even if precondition is aql:true. Need to duplicate tool but still doesn't work.
	Precondition don't have access to element, or self is on root of diagram, not drop element 
	-> MT_Drop_Employee
	
edge
	it should be easier to add 2 variables for conditionstyle on edge : source & target (to semantic elements)
	tree edge doesn't respect the doc : "Tree: this style can be seen as a special case of Manhattan, with always two vertical segments and an horizontal one between them. If one graphical element serves as the source for several edges using this style, their first vertical segment (the stem of the tree) will be merged, and their horizontal segments will all appear as a single line." Tree edges move several edges instead of only one and horizontal segments aren't aligned.
		-> Structure Organization, Management Hierarchy, ...

table / matrix
	label edit doesn't work (no action performs)
	variable 0 should be removed (dixit PCD)	
	-> FM_Performed

VSM completion
	- the tooltip associated to self variable should print the EClass name (and documentation)
	- completion on the parameter of oclIsTypeOf() search only in EClass name, not in prefix. So, all domain class are not proposed to completion. As the best practices is now to use prefix, it is a bigger problem than previous versions of Sirius. 
		
OrderTreeLayout : children expression validation/completion is based on root element of diagram instead of NodeMapping. Not consistent with the rest of VSM. 	
	
SVG image is not rendered at the contrainted size during initial creation of diagram or apply a new layer. An automatic resize fix it.
	-> Management Hierarchy
	
Export Images : some images are a blank vertical picture. Several image per representations with suffix _1 _2 , etc.
