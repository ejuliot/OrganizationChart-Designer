You'll need "Apache Maven 3": http://maven.apache.org/download.html to be installed on your computer.

To launch the build, go to the root of your git repository and type :

@mvn clean package@

Maven will bootstrap itself, download all the dependencies and build OrganizationChart. The output of the build is a p2 repository (an update site) generated here : 

@features/org.obeonetwork.dsl.organizationchart.update/target/repository@

To install it in an Eclipse installation use @Help/Install New Software@ and point to this location.

Launching the test is not harder, just type :

@mvn clean verify@

Maven will launch the tests and give you the result. 
Code coverage is captured thanks to Jacoco.
